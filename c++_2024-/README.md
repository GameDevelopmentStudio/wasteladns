CMake should let you configure the build for your environment of choice. You can edit "COMPILE_TARGET" inside src/main.cpp to alternate between the different tests.
Alternatively, you can run build.bat (on Windows) or build.sh (on Mac) to build the test specified by "COMPILE_TARGET" inside src/main.cpp.
